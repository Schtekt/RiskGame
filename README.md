RiskGame- INCOMPLETE!

How to set up the project for own use.

Add a directory "dependencies" in the same depth as the src directory.
In dependencies, add the directories "include" and "lib".
Add sfml files to include and lib, make sure that they are the 32 bit version!
(include files need to be organised in "SFML/*")

After this is done, use premake5 to build the project in visualstudio.

The main branch of this project was meant to make a full fledged desktop version of Risk. It was abandoned as the group ran out of time for the project. Insteada branch was created to develop an application to assist in visualizing data about the board game known as Go.

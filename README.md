How to set up the project for own use.

Add a directory "dependencies" in the same depth as the src library.
In dependencies, add the directories "include" and "lib".
Add sfml files to include and lib.
(include files need to be organised in "SFML/*")

After this is done, use premake5 to build the project in visualstudio.
